# 4. Strategic Positioning

LiveSurgery sits at the intersection of:

**MedTech × OR Integration × Surgical Education × Cloud Video Collaboration**

Key differentiators:
- Vendor-neutral interoperability  
- Cloud-first architecture  
- Designed for learning as much as livestreaming  
- Scalable, multi-site vision  

The PoC is the first building block toward hospital pilots, accelerator applications, and long-term MedTech partnerships.
